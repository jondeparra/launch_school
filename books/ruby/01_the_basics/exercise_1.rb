# Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your full name in one string.

# "<Firstname> <Lastname>"

# For example, if your name is John Doe, think about how you can put "John" and "Doe" together to get "John Doe".

# >> My Solution

first_name = 'Jonathan'
last_name = 'Parra'
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
# or
full_name = "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
p full_name

# >> Solution

"Bob " + "Smith"
